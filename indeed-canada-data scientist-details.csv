The base salary range considers many factors including, but not limited to experience, education, and training, including any collective agreement requirements for union represented positions. It is not typical for the salary to be offered near the top of the range, and salary is dependent on numerous factors. For management roles, the base salary range does not represent the total compensation package. The total compensation package for regular full-time management roles includes pay-for-performance programs for annual and medium time periods. Maintaining a high-performance culture and excellence is a core expectation of every member of our leadership team and is rewarded through the established compensation framework.


OPG is committed to employment equity. As such, we encourage applicants from equity-seeking communities (Indigenous Peoples, racialized persons, persons with disabilities, and women). We strongly believe that alleviating the under-representation of equity-seeking individuals will create a stronger OPG team and allow us to better serve the needs of our diverse communities.

Local Logic is digitizing the built world to make it universally understandable and actionable for consumers, investors, developers, and governments with the ambition of helping build cities that are more sustainable and equitable for the people who live in them.


To achieve that dream, we’ve built a digital twin of cities, quantifying the built world using data and AI to interpret the $217T real estate market throughout the US and Canada.


We started our journey at McGill University’s urban planning department, where we came to see that cities were being developed in all kinds of unsustainable ways. Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?


It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. However, we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities that we so desperately need.


Today, Local Logic delivers sophisticated location insights through webtools, APIs, one-click reports and a data analytics platform. Our insights are powered by billions of data points we’ve generated that describe all aspects of cities - from the distance to the nearest bus stop, the quietness on the street, to the most recent trends in the housing market and more.

Your Mission

As Data Scientist at Local Logic, you will be responsible for quantitative research on cities and real estate, on the one hand, and our product usage, on the other hand – all with the goal of helping to inform product strategy and to discover hidden value in our city and real estate data.

You are an agile researcher and strategist at your core, able to rapidly and creatively identify the right questions to ask, help others reframe their questions so they uncover bigger opportunities, understand the value of combining quantitative and qualitative exploratory and evaluative methods, and are excited about doing this at variable speeds and depths to respond to a constantly evolving start-up environment.


You believe in our mission and want to help us achieve it. You bring your own unique perspective to the team, so you can challenge the way we do things for the better. You’re able to speak up when you disagree, ask questions when you don’t understand, and take ownership of your work.

As Our Data Scientist, Your Responsibilities Will Include:

Conduct research on the value of our city and real estate data for the problems that matter for our target users and customers, which include home seekers, cities, real estate listing websites, and real estate developers and investors
Setup product analytics pipelines and reports for internal and external use
Develop the proof-of-concept for new data products and collaborate with data engineers to productionize them
Contribute to a culture of data-informed decision-making
Be a steward of data quality
Collaborate with product managers, developers, designers, other data scientists, and data engineers to contribute to product roadmap and requirements-gathering activities
Communicate across technical and non-technical teams internally about insights you generate in your analyses and about the strengths and risks of the methodologies and data you used to get there
Write reports for clients in French and English


Key Requirements:

At least 2 years of experience working as a data scientist in a company with very large quantities of data
At least 3 years of experience doing quantitative research (academic experience counts)
Experience with product analytics
Experience with machine learning and/or other modeling techniques
Experience with programming in Python and SQL for data analysis
Fluent in French and English
Embracing change. This is a startup environment and we sometimes pivot quickly.
Embracing ambiguity. Figuring out the right thing to do is part of the job (rather than executing a perfectly specified plan)
This is a hybrid position and it is expected that you will work from the Montreal office 2 days a week


Nice to Have:

Domain knowledge about the real estate sector and urban planning, especially as it relates to real estate investment, zoning, city planning, etc
Experience working with geospatial, multivariate and spatio-temporal data


Why Should You Work Here?

At Local Logic, you have an amazing opportunity to be an early team member of a Series B backed startup. We are focused on understanding the world and its cities to predict the future and make the real estate market more transparent.

We are a people-first company that strives to create the best experience for our employees by creating an inclusive, collaborative, challenging environment to learn and problem-solve on a daily basis.

You will have access to benefits such as:

Comprehensive health insurance on us
A health platform (telemedicine, Employee and Family Assistance Program (EFAP), mental health and stress management assistance) (*for Canadians only)
Stock options
Unlimited vacation
Intentional Fridays
Health and benefit allowance per year
Initial WFH allowance
Bike sharing membership on us
A cool office in the heart of Montreal

Your professional development is our priority. With a 1500 CAD annual professional development credit you’re encouraged to keep learning, explore new skills, and advance in your career. We want you to thrive, grow, and feel fulfilled while working on work that matters. Join us, and help us build a brighter future for cities around the world.

Our Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion

We’re aiming to build a diverse team and inclusive company culture. We are an equal opportunity employer (EOE) and do not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any legally protected status.

Notre Mission

Chez Local Logic, notre mission est d'améliorer toutes les décisions immobilières, qu'il s'agisse des consommateurs à la recherche d'un quartier qui correspond à leur style de vie, des investisseurs qui cherchent à repérer les meilleurs emplacements à développer, ou des gouvernements locaux qui s'efforcent de construire des villes plus durables grâce à une meilleure planification urbaine.

Nous avons commencé notre parcours au département d'urbanisme de l'université McGill, où nous avons constaté que les villes se développaient de toutes sortes de manières non durables. Pourquoi continuer à construire des banlieues tentaculaires, alors que cela a pour effet d'accroître la pollution et les inégalités ? Pourquoi de nouvelles zones d'activités sont-elles construites loin des transports en commun, alors que cela fait exploser les embouteillages ? Pourquoi les logements sociaux sont-ils construits dans des endroits qui exacerbent les problèmes sociaux au lieu de les améliorer ?

Nous avons compris pourquoi : Les villes sont incroyablement difficiles à comprendre. Mais, nous avons réalisé qu'avec les progrès récents de la science des données, toute la complexité des villes peut être simplifiée pour que n'importe qui puisse la comprendre. Cette compréhension est essentielle pour créer des villes durables, équitables et prospères dont nous avons désespérément besoin.

Aujourd'hui, notre vaste ensemble de plus de milliards de points de données fournit des informations et des analyses inégalées qui ont influencé des transactions immobilières d'une valeur de plusieurs milliards de dollars et qui aident en permanence plus de 15 millions d'utilisateurs mensuels, sur 8 000 sites web aux États-Unis et au Canada, à prendre des décisions plus éclairées.

Au cours de l'été 2023, nous avons obtenu un financement de série B afin d'agrandir notre équipe, d'améliorer nos produits et, en fin de compte, d'aider à construire les villes de demain.


Votre Mission

En tant que scientifique de données chez Local Logic, vous êtes responsable de faire de la recherche quantitative sur les villes et l'immobilier, d'une part, et de l'utilisation de nos produits, d'autre part, le tout dans le but d'aider à éclairer la stratégie produit et à découvrir la valeur cachée dans nos données urbaines et immobilières.

Vous êtes un chercheur et un stratège agile, capable d'identifier rapidement et de manière créative les bonnes questions à poser et d'aider les autres à recadrer leurs questions afin qu'ils découvrent de plus grandes opportunités. Vous avez de l'intérêt pour combiner des méthodes quantitatives et qualitatives, et vous êtes enthousiaste de travailler dans un environnement de start-up en constante évolution.

Vous croyez en notre mission et souhaitez nous aider à la réaliser. Vous apportez votre propre perspective unique à l’équipe, afin de pouvoir remettre en question notre façon de faire les choses pour le mieux. Vous êtes capable de vous exprimer lorsque vous n’êtes pas d’accord, de poser des questions lorsque vous ne comprenez pas et de vous approprier votre travail.

En tant que Data Scientist, vos responsabilités incluront :

Mener des recherches sur la valeur de nos données sur les villes et l'immobilier pour les problèmes importants pour nos utilisateurs et clients cibles, notamment les villes, les sites Web d'annonces immobilières, ainsi que les promoteurs et investisseurs immobiliers.
Mettre en place les chaînes de traitement de données pour l'analyse de produits ainsi que des rapports à usage interne et externe
Développer la preuve de concept pour les nouveaux produits de données et collaborer avec les ingénieurs de données pour les mettre en production
Contribuer à une culture de prise de décision éclairée par les données
Promouvoir une culture de la qualité des données
Collaborer avec les chefs de produit, les développeurs, d'autres scientifiques de données et ingénieurs de données pour contribuer à la feuille de route du produit et aux activités de collecte des exigences.
Communiquer en interne entre les équipes techniques et non techniques sur les informations que vous générez dans vos analyses et sur les avantages et les risques des méthodologies et des données que vous avez utilisées pour y parvenir.
Rédiger des rapports pour les clients en français et en anglais

Exigences clés :

Au moins 2 ans d'expérience en tant que scientifique des données dans une entreprise avec de très grandes quantités de données
Au moins 3 ans d'expérience en recherche quantitative (l'expérience académique compte)
Expérience avec l'analyse de produits
Expérience avec l'apprentissage automatique et/ou d'autres techniques de modélisation
Expérience en programmation en Python et SQL pour l'analyse de données
Maîtrise du français et de l'anglais
Apprécier le changement. Il s’agit d’un environnement de startup et nous pivotons parfois rapidement.
Apprécier l’ambiguïté. Déterminer la bonne chose à faire fait partie du travail (plutôt que d'exécuter un plan parfaitement spécifié)
Il s'agit d'un poste hybride et il est prévu que vous travailliez depuis le bureau de Montréal 2 jours par semaine.

Pourquoi travailler ici

Chez Local Logic, vous avez une incroyable opportunité de devenir l’un des premiers membres de l’équipe d’une startup soutenue par sa série B. Nous nous concentrons sur la compréhension du monde et de ses villes pour prédire l'avenir et rendre le marché immobilier plus transparent.

Nous sommes une entreprise qui priorise ses gens et qui s'efforce de créer la meilleure expérience pour ses employés en créant un environnement inclusif, collaboratif et stimulant pour apprendre et résoudre des problèmes au quotidien.

Vous aurez accès à des avantages tels que:

un régime d’assurance santé, de soins dentaires et de soins oculaires
des options d'achat d'actions
une politique de vacances compétitive
une culture qui met l'accent sur l'apprentissage et l'harmonie entre vie professionnelle et vie privée
Allocation initiale de travail à domicile
Vendredis intentionnels
Abonnement au vélo en libre-service (bixi)
Un bureau branché au cœur de Montréal

Votre développement professionnel est notre priorité. Grâce à un crédit annuel de 1500 CAD développement professionnel, vous êtes encouragés à continuer d’apprendre, à explorer de nouvelles compétences et à progresser dans votre carrière. Nous voulons que vous vous épanouissiez, que vous progressiez et que vous vous sentiez épanoui tout en travaillant sur des tâches importantes. Rejoignez-nous et aidez-nous à construire un avenir meilleur pour les villes du monde entier.

Notre engagement en faveur de la diversité et de l'inclusion

Nous visons à constituer une équipe diversifiée et une culture d'entreprise inclusive. Nous sommes un employeur souscrivant au principe de l'égalité des chances et ne pratiquons aucune discrimination fondée sur la race, la couleur, l'appartenance ethnique, l'ascendance, l'origine nationale, la religion, le sexe, l'identité ou l'expression sexuelle, l'orientation sexuelle, l'âge, le handicap, le statut de vétéran, les informations génétiques, l'état matrimonial ou tout autre statut protégé par la loi.

The successful candidate will obtain competitively awarded external research funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and other granting agencies to support a vibrant, innovative, and collaborative research program and to train the next generation of scientists and innovators.

The Canada Research Chair (CRC) program was established by the Canadian Federal Government with the purpose of attracting outstanding researchers to the Canadian university system. Tier 2 Chairs are intended for exceptional emerging scholars (i.e. the candidate must have been an active researcher in their field for fewer than 10 years at the time of nomination).

Qualifications

Candidates must hold a Ph.D. (or equivalent), be within 10 years of receiving their highest degree, and be an exceptional emerging researcher, acknowledged by their peers as having the potential to lead in their field.

The University recognizes that life circumstances such as illness, disability, family, and community will have an impact on a candidate’s record of research achievement, and these impacts will be taken into careful consideration during the assessment process. Note that Tier 2 Chair nominees may be more than 10 years from their highest degree if they have experienced legitimate career interruptions. More information on the CRC program, including eligibility criteria, can be found at http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca .

The University of Lethbridge is strongly committed to equity, diversity, inclusion, and reconciliation. This is demonstrated by its ongoing work, relationships, and connections with the Blackfoot Confederacy. The university strives to provide access and opportunity to historically excluded groups identified under the Employment Equity Act and to meet its equity and diversity targets as a key consideration when allocating a Chair position, selecting which field to support with a Chair, and deciding whether to limit the pool to internal candidates. In accordance with the University of Lethbridge Canada Research Chair Program – Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion Action Plan, we strongly encourage applications from skilled and experienced members of the four designated groups, such as Indigenous peoples, racialized individuals, persons with disabilities, women and gender minorities, as defined in the CRC Program method for establishing equity targets and the Employment Equity Act. The purpose of this measure is to increase and ensure equitable representation and contributions of these members in the allocation of Canada Research Chairs positions. In recognition of the underrepresentation of scholars with a disability and racialized scholars in our chairholders, and in accordance with Section 10.1 of the Alberta Human Rights Act, only applicants who self-identify as a person with a disability and/or as a racialized individual will be considered for this CRC opportunity.

The Accessible Canada Act defines disability as any impairment, including physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment – or a functional limitation- whether permanent, temporary or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society. As a requirement of this position, candidates are asked to complete the confidential self-identification form during the final application process. Please see the CRC website for additional information about self-identification.

Application Process

Applications for this position must include:

Day in the life:

When you get to the office, you have a nice chat with your colleagues before settling in for a meaningful workday. As a self-driven individual, you spend most of your morning working on analyzing some recent inspections data looking for trends and anomalies. Building a predictive model to better inform our inspections work is your primary responsibility right now and you delight in the work.

After a nice social lunch and an espresso (coffee is on us!), you come back to your desk to work on internal data policies, ensuring plain language the entire organization can understand and use. This work feeds into a presentation you’re giving to all staff to bring them along on your progress. Your work in progressing the organization’s overall data literacy means employees understand better than ever how data and analysis can enhance work processes. You gather feedback and commit to reviewing their concerns and suggestions and reporting back.

Before heading out, you look at tomorrow’s calendar. You’re meeting with the Inspections team to talk about their processes, a step that will continue your predictive modelling work. Although, you never know when a data analysis need comes up, so you are open to being flexible with your priorities as needs surface throughout the day. Afterall, you appreciate the ability to be involved with other departments and you are grateful for the opportunity to learn new things all the time.

Who you are:

An information seeking problem solver who can analyze an issue, identify underlying causes and generate solutions
A team player who enjoys working with diverse teams, work groups and across an organization to achieve group and organizational goals.
A proactive planner who can establish priorities but also be flexible and adapt to different situations, information and groups of individuals.

What you will be doing:

Using your advanced knowledge of statistics and analytical modeling to draw insights that inform strategic and operational decision-making.
Acting as the key statistical resource internally and externally with our stakeholders, including working on diverse teams or attending external meetings.
Guiding individuals, teams, and leadership in your areas of expertise to ensure work processes and procedures are effectively implemented and communicated across the organization.

We are looking for people who have:

Post-secondary education with a focus in statistics, mathematics, data science, research or other related fields of study or a combination of education and experience.
Minimum two years’ experience in advanced analytics, complex statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, data mining, data visualization and optimization.
Proven track-record of applying modeling techniques and statistics to solve real world problems.

Are we a good fit for each other?

When it comes to health, we’re always looking for ways to push for better. It’s why we were founded in the first place. In 1957, our founder, pharmacist William Wilkinson, witnessed a mother sacrifice her health by forgoing her own medicine to pay for her sick daughter’s prescription. He knew there had to be a better way. So, he introduced North America’s first prepaid drug plan, and GreenShield was born as a not-for-profit with a mission to support better health for all Canadians.

We aren’t just a health and benefits company. We’re the only not-for-profit social enterprise that brings worlds of coverage and care together, all in one place.

The main goal is to find candidates who have previous experience working on cross functional teams to identify the right problems to solve, prioritize those problems, identify success metrics (definition of success for the solution), identify a research plan to investigate a feasible solution that can achieve these success metrics, identify or create the data required to run the experiment, set up and run the experiments required to prove out the idea, communicate those results with the cross functional team and leadership, and iteratively adjust approach until we achieve a viable solution; then they should be able to deliver this solution in partnership with the engineers on our teams. They should also have experience introducing product analytics and working with UXR teams to investigate the effectiveness of their solutions post release to production so that they can identify how successful their solution is and then iterate on it.


This could involve developing novel approaches or improving on existing approaches. Experience with python is required. Experience working on production level systems alongside of product teams should be a requirement. (I am not keen on hiring scientists that only have experience with pure research - they should have some experience delivering these solutions. They don't need to be the ones doing the engineering work to deliver the solutions but they need to have had experience working alongside of these engineers to deliver their solutions.) Experience working with some cloud compute provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) should be a requirement with a preference for those candidates that have experience on AWS.

Why Cisco?

#WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!
Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco

Senior Associate, Data Analyst

Our Capital One DA Team.

Data is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging. We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.

Write SQL to clean, transform, investigate, and augment large, complex database tables

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.

CRWN.ai is a machine learning company that uses sensors to detect, localize, and categorize electrical discharge in real time, without an operator in the field. That’s the how. The why? Identifying the changes in frequency in electrical discharge allows us to give insight into areas of wildfire risk, power outages, and exceptional electrical discharge on powerlines. If this gets walked backwards you can start to see how we can look at CRWN as an application to clean energy, through providing real time data to identify areas of inefficiencies in the power grid (and obviously reducing the risk of wildfires is pretty clean and cool too).




Alright, so where do you fit in?

We have our firmware engineers, we have our hardware engineers and then we have you! CRWN is currently testing live on transmission lines. We are looking at our roadmap and know that the data is the most important thing to Utilities. You will be responsible for the following:
Visionary Data Strategy: Develop and execute a data strategy that aligns with our business goals. Establish the vision, tools, and processes necessary for data collection, processing, and analysis.
Data Collection and Integration: Identify and implement data collection methods and sources to gather high-quality data. Ensure the integration of various data streams.
Algorithm Development: Create, optimize, and train machine learning models and algorithms to extract actionable insights and predictions.
Data Analysis: Analyze data to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities. Translate data into clear and actionable recommendations for Utilities

And most importantly


The willingness to dive in and just ""figure it out”.


Skillset:

3+ Years Industry Experience in Machine Learning
Experience with TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite

Experience setting up data pipelines

Experience in audio processing and/or electronics

Comfortable overseeing the entire data collection, training and analysis process
Strong programming skills, especially in Python




Bonus Points:
Experience in Scrum
You love hiking. You will find yourself doing field data collection every now and then in the backwoods




Besides the Tech we have some pretty sweet perks:

Company paid for lunch on all sprint planning days
Flexible working environment: Monday - Thursday 10am-2pm PST hard hours, the rest is up to you!
We have an office in Kelowna, B.C. where everyone pops in and out of as needed. Some people are there 4 days a week, some are only there once a week (or not at all!)
We have a relocation package available as we see the greatest chance of success is going to be side by side with our team in a hybrid model, BUT if you have experience working remotely in a machine learning role, we are open to suggestions.
No meeting Fridays
5 weeks paid vacation + Mandatory Christmas shut down
Healthy options plan!

Our website is currently undergoing an update behind the scenes, so if you aren't quite convinced by this job posting to apply, check the website over the next few weeks.


HINT: A lot of our hires have stood out with a cover letter that hits on our main value of authenticity, so don't be scared of not sounding corporate enough in your cover letter. In fact, one of our best developers was hired based on his cover letter alone. We read every one!"

Work Where It’s Best for You

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.

Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.

We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

Work at Veeva. Work where it’s best for you."

Increasingly image and video data captures the content we watch, the products we buy, and the work we do, and already represents 80% of internet traffic. But rather than being an asset, visual content is often a tax or even a liability because it is so hard to work with and understand. Coactive solves this by bringing structure to unstructured visual data. Rather than spending months (or years) building complex infrastructure, data teams can unlock the value of their visual data in minutes to power use cases such as content understanding and moderation, search, and analytics.

Coactive was founded by experts who shaped the fields of high-performance deep learning and data-centric AI. We have the scars from building and working with the first generation of modern machine learning systems at Google, Meta, Pinterest, eBay, Lyft, and other leading organizations. Through our decades of experience, we have developed a playbook to democratize the toughest parts of machine learning systems; no PhD required.

This is an exceptional opportunity to work with one of Forbes' top 50 AI companies, backed by key investors such as Andreesen Horowitz and Bessemer Ventures.

Coactive facilite la recherche, le filtrage et l'analyse du contenu visuel. De plus en plus, les données d'image et vidéo se retrouvent dans le contenu que nous regardons, les produits que nous achetons et le travail que nous faisons, et représentent déjà 80 % du trafic Internet. Mais au lieu d'être un atout, le contenu visuel est souvent une taxe, voire un handicap, parce qu'il est difficile à utiliser et à comprendre. Coactive résout ce problème en apportant une structure aux données non structurées. Plutôt que de passer des mois (ou des années) à mettre en place une infrastructure complexe, les équipes chargées des données peuvent obtenir la valeur de leurs données visuelles en quelques minutes afin d'alimenter des cas d'utilisation tels que la compréhension et la modération du contenu, la recherche et l'analyse.

Description du sujet

Process industries including chemicals, oil and gas industries, pharmaceutics, mining, metals and pulp and paper play an important role in the Canadian economy. An unplanned shutdown of a large plant can cost several hundred thousand dollars.

Large amounts of process data of different type are collected during process operation and stored in process historians. Today, this valuable resource is not fully exploited because of the lack of dedicated tools and methods to extract reliable information from it. Detecting unintended deviations from normal operation or identifying the root cause of abnormal behavior becomes difficult with the ever-increasing amount and complexity of stored data.

Modern machine learning methods have the potential to support building robust and accurate process models able to predict the process behaviour and to diagnose abnormal process situations.

Professor Moncef Chioua’s group has an immediate opening for PhD position on the intersection of data analytics, machine learning and process control.

The selected candidate will be working on the development of novel algorithms and computational tools to support the operation of process systems.

The work will be done in collaboration with industrial partners which will provide the selected candidate an opportunity to work on real-life case studies, to discuss with industrial practitioners and to benefit from the experience of industrial researchers in creating and deploying new technology.

Job Description


Project Overview

Purpose:

Provide technical guidance, identify/gather/document/analyze business and technical requirements, and assist with solution design, implementation, processes, and support of technology projects and data projects. The projects that this role will be involved in will have a data-centric focus.

Contribute to projects related to BI and data visualization, integrated data and analytics platform/enterprise data lake, data and information sharing web portals, advanced analytics (AA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML).

Background:

The Government of Alberta (GoA) provides a number of services to Albertans. Every ministry provides a unique set of services. In doing so, large amounts of data are generated on a daily basis. GoA is in a position to use this data for the social good of its citizens by transforming the way it organizes itself, run its processes and make decisions.

The growing expectation of citizens is just one of the challenges facing governments today. Rapid urbanization, an aging population and complex socio-economic problems are putting public services under strain. With low economic growth that resulted in lower budgets, GoA need to find solutions that are both efficient and sustainable.

Globally, the private sector uses AA/AI/ML technologies to autombubuate tasks, make better decisions and improve customer experience. GoA recognizes the potential of these technologies to transform the way they organize themselves and run its processes. By use of such technologies, GoA can anticipate the expectations of citizens, create new services, and take appropriate action to provide services to enhance and secure their lives. Being a public body, there is a distinction in how use of such technologies would provide additional benefits to the GoA, as compared to the private sector.

GoA already has self-serve data visualization tools in place (e.g. SAS Visual Analytics, MS Power BI). Integrated data and analytics platform (data lake - Cloudera Data Platform) is in the later stages of implementation in the GoA. AI/ML tools are mainly in the conceptual or planning phase in GoA, although there may already be small pockets of implementation.

Role

Applied research involves applying concepts and methods emerging in fundamental research to real world contexts, exploring ways in which they might need to be changed to increase their relevance and scalability for teams throughout the company. In this role, you will work alongside other Trust & Governance applied researchers in the field of trustworthy AI. Overwhelmingly, this will involve working on challenges associated with large, generative models across a wide variety of use cases. In some cases, you

might work on training new models; in others, you might focus on risk detection and measurement for models built or fine-tuned by others. You will thrive in this role by being able to quickly understand the problem at hand, consider potential solutions, and validate your ideas. As part of the Trust & Governance Lab, good communication skills are a must to bridge gaps between teams in fundamental research, product, governance, and beyond.

Rôle

La recherche appliquée consiste à appliquer les concepts et les méthodes issus de la recherche fondamentale à des contextes réels, en explorant les moyens de les modifier pour accroître leur pertinence et leur évolutivité pour les équipes de l'ensemble de l'entreprise. Dans ce rôle, vous travaillerez aux côtés d'autres chercheurs appliqués en matière de confiance et de gouvernance dans le domaine de l'IA digne de confiance. La plupart du temps, il s'agira de travailler sur des défis associés à de grands modèles génératifs dans une grande variété de cas d'utilisation. Dans certains cas, vous travaillerez à la formation de nouveaux modèles ; dans d'autres, vous vous concentrerez sur la détection et la mesure des risques pour les modèles construits ou affinés par d'autres. Vous vous épanouirez dans ce rôle en étant capable de comprendre rapidement le problème, d'envisager des solutions potentielles et de valider vos idées. Dans le cadre du Trust & Governance Lab, de bonnes compétences en communication sont indispensables pour faire le pont entre les équipes de recherche fondamentale, de produits, de gouvernance et autres.


Qualifications


To be successful in this role you have:

A Master’s degree with 4 years of relevant experience (preferably in industry) or a Ph.D. in a relevant field with 2 years of relevant experience;
Passion for and demonstrated experience in trustworthiness-related topics;
Familiarity and experience working with a range of approaches to evaluating, benchmarking and testing the performance and risks in large language and other generative AI models;
Familiarity with adversarial testing approaches, including but not limited to red teaming;
Experience using state-of-the-art generative models for inference and in fine-tuning and evaluating such models is an important asset;
Experience building and working with prototypes of models and measurement approaches, as well as a capacity to quickly validate whether a certain avenue is worth pursuing;
Experience conducting literature reviews and evaluating and implementing (sometimes from scratch) promising solutions identified;
Familiarity with popular deep learning frameworks and tools, such as PyTorch, Hugging Face models, DeepSpeed, etc.
Ability to work on large projects with self-directed initiatives;
Capacity to deal well with ambiguity, prioritizing needs, and delivering results in a dynamic environment;
Ability to communicate research findings to a non-research audience; and
A ‘getting things done’ mindset.

Pour réussir dans ce rôle, vous avez :

Une passion et une expérience concrète sur les sujets liés à la fiabilité des modèles d’IA;
Familiarité et expérience avec un éventail d'approches pour évaluer, comparer et tester les performances et les risques dans les modèles de langage et autres modèles d'intelligence artificielle génératifs;
Familiarité avec les différentes approches de ‘red-teaming’;
L'expérience de l'utilisation de modèles génératifs de pointe pour l'inférence, ainsi que de la mise au point et de l'évaluation de ces modèles, constitue un atout important ;
Expérience de la construction et du travail avec des prototypes de modèles et d'approches de mesure, ainsi qu'une capacité à valider rapidement si une certaine voie vaut la peine d'être poursuivie;
Une familiarité à faire une revue de la littérature ainsi que l’implémentation (parfois à partir de zéro) de la meilleure solution que vous avez trouvée;
Familiarité avec les cadres et outils populaires d'apprentissage profond, tels que PyTorch, les modèles Hugging Face, DeepSpeed, etc;
Une habileté à travailler sur de gros projets de façon autonome;
Une capacité à travailler avec l’ambigüité, prioriser les besoins et produire des résultats dans un environnement dynamique;
Une habileté à vulgariser des résultats scientifiques à une audience qui n’a pas d’expertise en IA; et
Une attitude qui priorise les résultats plutôt que les méthodes.

The aim of the projects is to improve health outcomes and facilitate evidence-based decision making about mental and substance use disorders and other adverse outcomes (e.g., overdose) for clinicians, health service providers and policymakers through the translation and implementation of AI and ML in the real world beyond research settings.

The University of Alberta acknowledges that we are located on Treaty 6 territory, and respects the histories, languages and cultures of First Nations, Metis, Inuit and all First Peoples of Canada, whose presence continues to enrich our vibrant community.

The Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry at the University of Alberta is one of Canada’s premiere health-sciences institutes, and in recent years has ranked among the top 50 medical schools in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

Current and potential projects include two main directions: 1) Individualized prediction of mental and substance use disorders and overdoses and associated health and economical outcomes in the population using health, survey and biological data; 2) Implementation of ML models through interactions with multiple stakeholders and people with living and lived experiences.

The successful applicants will have the opportunity of supervised access to several public and government/institution owned datasets, including large (over 4 million people) de-identified health data from Alberta. In this context, there are excellent opportunities for shared mentorship and collaboration with several PIs in psychiatry and computing science, including the Alberta machine intelligence institute (Amii).

The successful applicants will play a leadership role for several research projects in computational psychiatry, develop and participate in preparation of research grant proposals, assist in the supervision and training of other personnel including technologists, graduate students, other lab members and scientific collaborators. The successful applicant will also have the opportunity to work directly with our partners in Ministries of Alberta Government, Alberta Health Services (AHS) and Canadian Mental Health Association Edmonton, as well as international partners.
