While working in a range of Medicaid covered health care and human services, you will be involved in the full breadth of Medicaid programs. The work relies heavily on knowledge and skills in health services and policy research. You will use health data analytics to develop accurate, responsive, and appropriately detailed analyses. You will measure and monitor Medicaid enrollment, utilization, expenditures and program performance. It regularly requires the ability to assess eligibility, assess health data needs and data gaps, evaluate the quality of existing data, and integrate existing data to ensure its usefulness for decision-making. These data can be used to evaluate health status, analyze the effectiveness of policies and programs, and monitor the effectiveness of interventions in terms of health outcomes and cost of services.





Mission:
The Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA)'s mission is to improve Vermonters' health and well-being by providing access to high-quality, cost-effective health care.

We actively celebrate our colleagues' and future colleagues' different abilities, racial identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, and gender. Everyone is welcome and supported here.





Our State:
Vermont is a ""small but mighty"" state. We are ranked as one of the top 10 states to raise a family in 2022. We are nationwide leaders for progressive social and educational policies. We are in Northern New England, 1.5 hours from Montreal and 3.5 hours from Boston. We have beautiful Lake Champlain, the Green Mountains, and year-round outdoor activities.

Job Description

About BioLife Plasma Services

BioLife Plasma Services, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., is an industry leader in the collection of high-quality plasma that is processed into life-saving plasma-based therapies. Some diseases can only be treated with medicines made with plasma. Since plasma can’t be made synthetically, many people rely on plasma donors to live healthier, happier lives. BioLife operates 230+ state-of-the-art plasma donation centers across the United States. Our employees are committed to improving the quality of life for patients and ensuring that the donation process is safe, easy, and rewarding for donors who want to make a difference.

When you work at BioLife, you’ll feel good knowing what we do helps improve the lives of patients with rare diseases. While you focus on our donors, we’ll support you. We offer a purpose you can believe in, a team you can count on, opportunities for career growth, and a comprehensive benefits program, all in a fast-paced, friendly environment.

What the role entails:

Some of the key responsibilities of our Generative AI Solution Engineer will be:

Data collection and preprocessing
Identify all data sources required by the system, including documents, databases, web pages etc
Define data requirements for data engineers who will set up the proper data pipelines (including using Bedrock’s action groups or function calling to fetch real-time data).
Ensure the data is clean and free from errors and irrelevant information. Enrich data with enough background information for the LLMs to learn.
Ensure proper semantic representations of (numeric) tables, so an LLM can ""see"" the structure – e.g., use models such as Amazon Textract to turn tabular data into semantic HTML or Markdown format that LLMs can understand. Further consider extra representation engineering if dealing with long tables to help extract the correct semantic structure for LLMs.
Extract meta data when needed – e.g., based on LLMs or regex-based custom code.
Data chunking:
Consider the nature of the data (e.g., structured, semi-structured or unstructured; whether tabular; whether numeric), use case requirements (whether precise answer is required) and system performance (quality vs. speed vs. running cost).
Then choose the best chunking approach (e.g., semantic chunking, fixed-length chunking, sliding window chunking, hierarchical chunking, chunking based on custom code etc.) accordingly.
Creating and storing knowledge embeddings:
Explore different embedding models (e.g., AWS Titan variants) on Bedrock and select the best performing one.
Work with DB engineer to choose the right DB (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch, Kendra, Pinecone or Aurora) to store the knowledge embeddings, judging by the trade-off between quality, speed and running cost.
User queries processing:
Figure out how to best transform the queries prior to retrieval – such as customizing Bedrock’s default prompt template for guided query decomposition, and making use of simple LLMs to ask user for missing information if needed via customizing the prompt template for example.
Query embedding and information retrieving:
Convert transformed queries into an embedding using the same model as in the knowledge embedding step.
Then retrieve the most relevant vectorized knowledge chunks, based on similarity search.
Filter on metadata if needed.
Post-retrieval processing:
Figure out how to best use simple summarizing LLMs and third-party ranking models (e.g., bge-reranker-large from Hugging Face) to summarize or re-rank the retrieved information.
Generating Responses:
Feed the combined queries and information chunks to LLMs, to generate the right response – the GenAI engineer needs to choose the best generative LLM (AWS Titan models, Antropic Claude models, Jurassic and Jamba models, Meta Llama models, or Mistral models etc.) from Bedrock based on the manual documentation and experimentation.
Implement the mathematical aggregation (via arithmetic) of multiple cells required by data analysis via AWS Bedrock’s action groups or function calling (set up as a dedicated calculator tool for reliable results) which are called during content generation by LLMs.
Ensure mandatory semantics rules (such as “the paylines must be within xxx range”) is enforced on LLM via prompt engineering in the prompt template for example, which triggers certain retrieval and/ or generation behaviour (e.g. metadata filtering and/ or adjust the generation content to fulfil the rules).
Post-generation processing:
Figure out how to best implement response quality checking (e.g., use Bedrock’s action groups or function calling to programmatically examine whether certain required information is generated, and further trigger LLMs to request users for input if needed via customizing prompt template for example).
Maintain the history of a conversation if needed (e.g. via Converse API), so users can submit adjustment requirements via a dialogue manner.






What we ask of you:

Experience of designing, developing and implementing LLMs based conversational AI products in cloud platforms, such as AWS Bedrock.
Hands-on experience of RAG, LLM fine-tuning, advanced prompt engineering and handling LLM hallucinations

What the role entails:

Some of the key responsibilities of our Generative AI Solution Engineer will be:

Data collection and preprocessing
Identify all data sources required by the system, including documents, databases, web pages etc
Define data requirements for data engineers who will set up the proper data pipelines (including using Bedrock’s action groups or function calling to fetch real-time data).
Ensure the data is clean and free from errors and irrelevant information. Enrich data with enough background information for the LLMs to learn.
Ensure proper semantic representations of (numeric) tables, so an LLM can ""see"" the structure – e.g., use models such as Amazon Textract to turn tabular data into semantic HTML or Markdown format that LLMs can understand. Further consider extra representation engineering if dealing with long tables to help extract the correct semantic structure for LLMs.
Extract meta data when needed – e.g., based on LLMs or regex-based custom code.
Data chunking:
Consider the nature of the data (e.g., structured, semi-structured or unstructured; whether tabular; whether numeric), use case requirements (whether precise answer is required) and system performance (quality vs. speed vs. running cost).
Then choose the best chunking approach (e.g., semantic chunking, fixed-length chunking, sliding window chunking, hierarchical chunking, chunking based on custom code etc.) accordingly.
Creating and storing knowledge embeddings:
Explore different embedding models (e.g., AWS Titan variants) on Bedrock and select the best performing one.
Work with DB engineer to choose the right DB (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch, Kendra, Pinecone or Aurora) to store the knowledge embeddings, judging by the trade-off between quality, speed and running cost.
User queries processing:
Figure out how to best transform the queries prior to retrieval – such as customizing Bedrock’s default prompt template for guided query decomposition, and making use of simple LLMs to ask user for missing information if needed via customizing the prompt template for example.
Query embedding and information retrieving:
Convert transformed queries into an embedding using the same model as in the knowledge embedding step.
Then retrieve the most relevant vectorized knowledge chunks, based on similarity search.
Filter on metadata if needed.
Post-retrieval processing:
Figure out how to best use simple summarizing LLMs and third-party ranking models (e.g., bge-reranker-large from Hugging Face) to summarize or re-rank the retrieved information.
Generating Responses:
Feed the combined queries and information chunks to LLMs, to generate the right response – the GenAI engineer needs to choose the best generative LLM (AWS Titan models, Antropic Claude models, Jurassic and Jamba models, Meta Llama models, or Mistral models etc.) from Bedrock based on the manual documentation and experimentation.
Implement the mathematical aggregation (via arithmetic) of multiple cells required by data analysis via AWS Bedrock’s action groups or function calling (set up as a dedicated calculator tool for reliable results) which are called during content generation by LLMs.
Ensure mandatory semantics rules (such as “the paylines must be within xxx range”) is enforced on LLM via prompt engineering in the prompt template for example, which triggers certain retrieval and/ or generation behaviour (e.g. metadata filtering and/ or adjust the generation content to fulfil the rules).
Post-generation processing:
Figure out how to best implement response quality checking (e.g., use Bedrock’s action groups or function calling to programmatically examine whether certain required information is generated, and further trigger LLMs to request users for input if needed via customizing prompt template for example).
Maintain the history of a conversation if needed (e.g. via Converse API), so users can submit adjustment requirements via a dialogue manner.






What we ask of you:

Experience of designing, developing and implementing LLMs based conversational AI products in cloud platforms, such as AWS Bedrock.
Hands-on experience of RAG, LLM fine-tuning, advanced prompt engineering and handling LLM hallucinations
Strong technical proficiency with Python, SQL and AWS. Able to write production quality code and have adequate version control skills.
Strong understanding of DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines.
Experience of closely working with data scientists and data engineers.

What we’re like:

Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.

Those pioneers started AIS because they not only believed in the potential of the industry, but the necessity to provide the United States with the offensive and defensive capabilities needed to gain the high ground in cyber warfare.

Decades later, the pirate flag waves tall outside of our headquarters, and we continue to develop and envision technologies that protect our nation and our warfighters.

We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However, make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers’ ecosystems to help people.

We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close-knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful companies. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we are looking to add Senior Data Science Developers to our team in Pune.

You have hands-on experience using AI frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras in a work setting. You have at least a couple of years of work experience using Python/R. You’ve used multiple classification models and Pandas, Numpy, Matlab etc. You are proficient at using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, DNN, CNN etc. You have a track record of demonstrated success in business problem solving. Data visualization experience is a plus.

You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the data science world and know the differences between classification, regression, clustering, dimensional reduction and time series. You know the limitations of each algorithm. You are motivated to learn new technologies.

That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

Who we are:

We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.

Who you’ll be working with:

We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote teams. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You’ll find our technology managers a joy to work with; people with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up their sleeves and get deep into technical issues. Our management possesses rare technical insight coupled with a remarkable business vision. You’ll be working as a key member of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

Your work environment:

We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and though we are a software company, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity. We believe in compensating our core team with higher than prevailing market wage.

Your skills:

You keep up with technology changes and trends.

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them.

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs.

You are skilled at development with Python/R and using Ai frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras.

Proficient in the use of Pandas, Numpy, Matlib, MatPlotlib, SciKit-learn and commonly used libraries.

You understand ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, XgBoost, DNN, CNN etc thoroughly.

You are quick to understand business problems and understand how to analyze large datasets, balance data to fill in missing gaps, and figure out which algorithms may best be used to solve a particular question or issue.

Any data visualization experience is a plus as is any background in statistics.

You have developed, implemented and supported a ML application successfully at work.

We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However, make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers’ ecosystems to help people.

We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close-knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful companies. Our track record building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we are looking to add Senior Data Science Developers to our team in Pune.

You have hands-on experience using AI frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras in a work setting. You have at least a couple of years of work experience using Python/R. You’ve used multiple classification models and Pandas, Numpy, Matlab etc. You are proficient at using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, DNN, CNN etc. You have a track record of demonstrated success in business problem solving. Data visualization experience is a plus.

You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the data science world and know the differences between classification, regression, clustering, dimensional reduction and time series. You know the limitations of each algorithm. You are motivated to learn new technologies.

That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:

Who we are:

We are an Insurtech company with a core mission of leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time.

We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.

Who you’ll be working with:

We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, our software lab is located in Pune, India. We have decades of experience working with remote teams. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Pune, India.

You’ll find our technology managers a joy to work with; people with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up their sleeves and get deep into technical issues. Our management possesses rare technical insight coupled with a remarkable business vision. You’ll be working as a key member of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.

Your work environment:

We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and though we are a software company, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.

We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office. We conduct meetings on a daily basis with our Chicago office so some overlapping hours are necessary.

Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.

We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity. We believe in compensating our core team with higher than prevailing market wage.

Your skills:

You keep up with technology changes and trends.

You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code and you understand the need for coding standards and why everyone should use them.

You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs.

You are skilled at development with Python/R and using Ai frameworks such as Tensor Flow and Keras.

Proficient in the use of Pandas, Numpy, Matlib, MatPlotlib, SciKit-learn and commonly used libraries.

You understand ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Tree, XgBoost, DNN, CNN etc thoroughly.

You are quick to understand business problems and understand how to analyze large datasets, balance data to fill in missing gaps, and figure out which algorithms may best be used to solve a particular question or issue.

Any data visualization experience is a plus as is any background in statistics.

You have developed, implemented and supported a ML application successfully at work.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.

Travel: This role will require travel to our clients around the US

Annual Salary: $140,000 - $200,000 + OTE

Please Note: If your salary expectations look a little different to that outlined, we’d still be keen to hear from you if this is a role that excites you and one that you think you could really excel in.

Our Mission

Our ambition is to help bring forward next-generation pricing and underwriting to today by combining advanced technology with a strong understanding of the business needs and challenges of the Specialty & Commercial P&C Insurance and Reinsurance markets.

We are currently partnered with some of the largest and most cutting-edge names in the market including Beazley and Markel - and our client base is growing rapidly. Over the last 3 years, we have grown from a 15-person start-up to a 140-person scale-up with teams in London at The Ministry, Borough, and Warsaw at Brain Embassy, Czackiego.

Fresh off the back of a $73m Series B funding round from a16z and Battery Ventures, we are now expanding our product offering into the US insurance market, and establishing our US headquarters in New York.

Lead Actuarial Data Scientist at hyperexponential

The Lead Actuarial Data Scientist would sit within our 5 person Solutions Engineering team and provides a world-class technical capability and domain knowledge to our GTM function, with a mission to supercharge its three core pillars of Sales, Marketing, and Customer.

Our primary objective is to help our customers realise the full value of our platform – we specialise in handling only the most difficult and interesting problems that our customers face, where only a combination of technical depth, market expertise and Renew knowledge will do.

This journey begins long before the sales process, where we develop and maintain a growing suite of demo tools and models that we weaponise during the sales process to clearly communicate the benefits of hx Renew. We welcome and encourage challenges during live demonstrations, where we show slick on-the-fly changes to example models, to highlight the flexibility of the platform.

We typically prove the value and flexibility of the platform in a proof of concept by rapidly building and improving an existing model from the prospect.

Your mission

As a Lead Actuarial Data Scientist, you'll play a fundamental role in the day-to-day execution of the team's mission.

You'll be a trusted advisor to our prospects - but you know that trust has to be earned. To do so you'll use your excellent interpersonal skills and technical credibility to establish a rapport with your counterparts during the Sales process, catalysing a long-term relationship that'll underpin the success of our future partnership.

You'll be the experts' expert, knowing hx Renew top-to-bottom, inside-out - both breadth and depth. You'll know its limits and which can be pushed. You'll know every trick in the book, the secret combos, and the cheat codes. You'll combine all of this with a deep knowledge of insurance technology to present 'the art of the possible' (and sometimes seemingly impossible!) to various stakeholders: actuaries, underwriters, IT, and exec.

You will collaborate closely with Sales, Engineering, Marketing, Product, Customer, and Model Development teams. Your approach will be customer-centric yet business-savvy, crafting solutions with the company’s products and presenting them as viable options. You’ll need to actively observe customer behaviour and predict future needs for product development.

You’ll also be expected to play a pivotal role as we build out a community of pythonistas & product evangelists in New York and the wider US. This is expected to include joining, and occasionally hosting, meet-ups with other actuaries and developers as we build a developer community!

This, however, only scratches the surface of opportunity – hyperexponential is growing very quickly and our product is being used in an increasing (and sometimes unexpected!) number of ways across the market. If you join us, it’s likely your journey could be similarly fast-paced and surprising!

As the first Lead Actuarial Data Scientist in the US, you’ll essentially be part of a start-up inside of a scale-up, with the opportunity to define the way we show the value of hx Renew with respect to the US insurance market. This will require you to be a generalist - the right person for this role will be excited about the fact they will often be operating outside of their typical lanes!

What will you do?

Shape the hx Renew demo and Proof of Concept (POC) offering with respect to the US insurance market, for both admitted and non-admitted business.

Contribute to the creation of reusable sales assets to reduce sales cycle, such as:

Exploring innovative ways to create interactive demos.

New template models that will expedite the POC process.

Planning and delivery of product demos to prospective clients with a focus on persona-based messaging. Personas include actuaries, underwriters, IT, and executive members. This includes working closely with Customer and Solution Architect teams to develop and iterate art-of-the-possible demos through innovation and integrations.

Running proof of concepts (POCs) to demonstrate the capability of Renew – often requiring you to innovate at the edge of our capabilities as they look to challenge us with their more technical or complex use cases.

Explorative workshopping with our US clients and prospects to understand the nuances between how hx Renew solves pain points for US vs non-US companies, and sharing these learnings with the Sales team.

Work in sync with the product marketing and engineering teams and develop sustainable and commercially viable products - iterating sales and demo materials to include any new product features.

Liaise with the marketing team to undertake demand-generating activities such as conferences, webinars, or customer workshops.

Develop and maintain a strong relationship with UK-based Solutions Engineers.

Work with the Model Development Team to share and adopt knowledge and best practices.

Support the answering of RFPs and RFIs for our sales team.

The role reports to the Lead Solutions Engineer.

Attend events and play a pivotal role in building a developer community.

What will you need to succeed in this role?

US Specialty Commercial P&C (re)insurance market background, with an understanding of the typical Target Operating Model of a US (re)insurer, and where Pricing/Rating drives value for the client.

Including experience operating across E&S & Admitted lines.

Strong technical grounding in Python.

Strong presentation skills.

Solution-oriented analytical skills.

Ability to initiate conversations and make a lasting impact.

Goal-focused and winning mentality.

We also highly value:

Experience working in a customer-facing role.

Interview Process

An initial phone call to see if we fit.

Technical assessment/role-play with the Solutions Engineering team.

Present back the Excel model.

Code review/walkthrough.

Short live coding assessment.

Interview our Lead Solutions Engineer Josh & Risa Head of US P&C, which will cover:

Industry/market knowledge.

Strategy.

Team/cultural fit.

This, however, only scratches the surface of opportunity – hyperexponential is growing very quickly and our product is being used in an increasing (and sometimes unexpected!) number of ways across the market. If you join us, it’s likely your journey could be similarly fast-paced and surprising!

As the first Lead Actuarial Data Scientist in the US, you’ll essentially be part of a start-up inside of a scale-up, with the opportunity to define the way we show the value of hx Renew with respect to the US insurance market. This will require you to be a generalist - the right person for this role will be excited about the fact they will often be operating outside of their typical lanes!

What will you do?

Shape the hx Renew demo and Proof of Concept (POC) offering with respect to the US insurance market, for both admitted and non-admitted business.

Contribute to the creation of reusable sales assets to reduce sales cycle, such as:

Exploring innovative ways to create interactive demos.

New template models that will expedite the POC process.

Planning and delivery of product demos to prospective clients with a focus on persona-based messaging. Personas include actuaries, underwriters, IT, and executive members. This includes working closely with Customer and Solution Architect teams to develop and iterate art-of-the-possible demos through innovation and integrations.

Running proof of concepts (POCs) to demonstrate the capability of Renew – often requiring you to innovate at the edge of our capabilities as they look to challenge us with their more technical or complex use cases.

Explorative workshopping with our US clients and prospects to understand the nuances between how hx Renew solves pain points for US vs non-US companies, and sharing these learnings with the Sales team.

Work in sync with the product marketing and engineering teams and develop sustainable and commercially viable products - iterating sales and demo materials to include any new product features.

Liaise with the marketing team to undertake demand-generating activities such as conferences, webinars, or customer workshops.

Develop and maintain a strong relationship with UK-based Solutions Engineers.

Work with the Model Development Team to share and adopt knowledge and best practices.

Support the answering of RFPs and RFIs for our sales team.

The role reports to the Lead Solutions Engineer.

Attend events and play a pivotal role in building a developer community.

What will you need to succeed in this role?

US Specialty Commercial P&C (re)insurance market background, with an understanding of the typical Target Operating Model of a US (re)insurer, and where Pricing/Rating drives value for the client.

Including experience operating across E&S & Admitted lines.

Strong technical grounding in Python.

Strong presentation skills.

Solution-oriented analytical skills.

Ability to initiate conversations and make a lasting impact.

Goal-focused and winning mentality.

We also highly value:

Experience working in a customer-facing role.

Interview Process

An initial phone call to see if we fit.

Technical assessment/role-play with the Solutions Engineering team.

Present back the Excel model.

Code review/walkthrough.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Senior Associate , Data Science - Applied Generative AI for Calls and Documents

Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

Team Description:

The Servicing Intelligence data science team leverages deep learning model architectures to help our internal customers use unstructured, multi-modal data sources — text, image, and audio data. We partner with product, tech, and business teams to deliver solutions spanning from using generative AI to conduct information extraction on millions of document images to analyzing call transcripts to identify customer pain points. You will be the driving force to experiment, innovate, and create next generation experiences powered by the latest emerging generative AI technologies.

Role Description:

In this role, you will:

Harness the power of transformer model architectures to automatically identify emerging customer pain points in millions of call transcripts.

Fine-tune large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) for extractive and abstractive tasks to search for complex evidence statements in unstructured, multi-page, documents images.

Manage large scale data annotation projects by guiding frontline agents to curate high quality datasets, delivering model improvements by proposing, managing, and monitoring improvements to data collection processes.

Work on a team of data scientists to build practical machine learning solutions through all phases of development, including designing, training, evaluating, and monitoring models.

Communicate frequently with business stakeholders, including everything from brainstorming verbiage to include in a prompt engineering experiment to ascertaining which model evaluation metric best aligns data science outputs with business objectives.

Collaborate with machine learning engineers to develop, deploy, troubleshoot, optimize, and maintain model pipelines with activities spanning from building reusable Kubeflow components for LLM fine-tuning to conversing about the cost impacts of model architecture choices.

Leverage a broad stack of technologies including Pytorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, LLaMA-Factory, GitHub, AWS and more, to automate workflows using huge volumes of text audio, and vision data


The Ideal Candidate is:

Creative. You thrive on bringing definition to big, undefined problems. You love asking questions and pushing hard to find answers. You’re not afraid to share a new idea.

Innovative. You continually research and evaluate emerging technologies. You stay current on published state-of-the-art methods, technologies, and applications and seek out opportunities to apply them.

Technical. You’re comfortable with open-source languages and are passionate about developing further. You have hands-on experience developing data science solutions using open-source tools and cloud computing platforms.

Statistically-minded. You’ve built models, validated them, and backtested them. You know how to interpret a confusion matrix or a ROC curve.

Passionate about the applied use of data science - when you see a new generative model take the top spot on a HuggingFace model leaderboard, you are just as excited about how it can improve a business process as you are about the underlying technical innovations.

You have an ownership mindset for all upstream and downstream impacts to model pipelines. You like to question what imperfections exist in a model benchmark, taking self-initiative to fix data quality issues in evaluation data.
